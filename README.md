# Artificial_Life -> random3D

In this version, I've expanded the design space ("morphospace") of the kinematic chain that I created in the branch **kinematicSnakes** by allowing the chain to branch in 3D. These new creatures also contain a random number of randomly shaped links with random sensor placement along the links and random motor placement along the joints. The blue color indicates the links without any sensor and the green color indicates the links with a touch sensor. The number of randomly generated creatures is defined in **constants.py** as 100, and it can be changed before running the program. The number of links to be generated is defined as a random function between the given range in the constructor of **solution.py** as self.maxNumLinks. This range can also be updated before running the program.

## Sensor Placements

The creatures in our random3D world currently have touch sensors. Whether a link will have a sensor is defined with the help of a probabilty threshold and a random number generating function withing the range: [0, 1). After each link is created, the random function is called and if the generated number is **less than** the threshold defined in the constructor of Solution.py as "self.probSensor = 0.5", then the corresponding link will have a sensor. Therefore, the probability of each link having a sensor is roughly 0.5 (or 50%). Practically, it is a little bit higher than 0.5, since the range of the random number generating function is inclusive of the lower bound 0 and exclusive of the upper bond 1, hence it is a bit left-skewed. In other words, [0.0,0.5) is a bigger infinite set of numbers than (0.5,1.0), because the 0.0 is included and the 1.0 is excluded.

## Motor Placements

Similar to sensors, placement of the motors is also decided with the help of a random number generating function and a probability threshold defined as " self.probMotor = 0.7" in Solution.py.

## Morphospace

### World

The world is currently empty with no objects present in it except for a 3D plane. The world does contain a gravitational force.

### Creature - Body

The creatures in our random3D world are created using cuboids of random dimensions. 

![Cuboid faces and the corresponding direction vectors](https://github.com/vTheWise/Artificial_Life/blob/random3D/Diagrams/Cube_Faces.jpg?raw=true)

The limbs of the creatures are added randomly with the help of a couple of probability thresholds and random number generating functions.
The variable **self.probExtend** in Solution.py acts as a probability threshold to determine whether the next link will be created on the same face. Similarly another variable **self.probSwitchFace** in the same class works as a probability threshold to determine whether the next link will be created in a different face. A dictionary **self.probNextFace** is defined with the directions (such as, [1,0,0] for front face, [0,-1,0] for left face, etc.) as the keys and a list of self.probExtend and self.probSwitchFace variables as values. The probability of extending in the opposite face is 0. So, if the current link is generated on the front face, the next link cannot be generated in the back face. Similarly, if the current link was generated on the left face, the next link cannot be generated on the right face. This rule preserves the natural growth of the creature avoiding link-intersections and link-pooling.

Here are some sample bodies generated by our program:

### Creature - Brain

Our creatures contain a brain-like structure consisting of a neural network with sensor and motor neurons. In this network, every sensor neuron is connected with every motor neuron with a synapse having a random weight (later, we'll evolve this creature through multiple generations, so that the synaptic weights can be adjusted for obtaining some desired behavior). Since, we are using a dense/fully-connected layer of neurons, the sensor on one part of the body will also affect the motors on other parts of the body.

### Creature - Movement

Our creatures possess hinge joints of "revolution" type, each of which allows for free movement in 2 axes. The placement of joints can be better understood with the help of the following diagram: [source](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zvZzFyTf8PBNjzQZx_gZk84aUntZo2bUKhpe78yT4OY/edit#slide=id.g10dad2fba23_2_428)

![Joints Placement](https://github.com/vTheWise/Artificial_Life/blob/random3D/Diagrams/Joints%20Position.png?raw=true)

If the link is generated alongside z-axis (direction: [0, 0, 1] or [0, 0, -1]), then the joints on this link can move along the x-y plane. Similarly, if the link is generated alongside y-axis, the movement is allowed along the x-z plane. And, for the links generated alongside x-axis, free movement is allowed along the y-z plane. 

The movement of the joints can be understood with the help of these diagrams:
